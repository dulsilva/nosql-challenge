# nosql-challenge
Background: 

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

In this challenge we were tasked with using mongo import to learn to import a json file into a database named uk_foods. I found a challenge when trying to import my json file into jupyter lab using the terminal. I looked for online resources such as youtube tutorials and stack overflow for guidance but still could not grasp the content and steps for importation. I understand the structure of a mongo import shown in my import example during set up, however failed to properly importing the file causing me to fail in the analysis. I however, continued to fill in the code for the rest of the set up so when I find the solution to importation I can have the rest of the set up to complete with ease.
